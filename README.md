# Product Dashboard
This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.0.

## Overview
This is an Angular-based Product Dashboard application that allows users to browse products, filter and sort them, manage favorites, and handle a shopping cart. The project is built with NgRx for state management, supports i18n (internationalization), and includes performance optimizations.

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed the following:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- Angular CLI (v15+)
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
npm install
```
## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```
Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

To execute end-to-end tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io), use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```
